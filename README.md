# Unibody Kickoff (Application Launcher)

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This repository contains the version of KDE's Kickoff (Application Launcher) widget without the patches which introduced a permanent search field and separator lines.

Users may want to use this version of Kickoff in the case that the search field sticks out too much for them or simply if they prefer the old look. 

The goal of the project is to keep providing backported fixes to Kickoff, all the while retaining its unibody look.

**Comparison between Kickoff and Kickoff (Fieldless):**
