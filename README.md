# Fieldless Kickoff

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This repository contains the version of KDE's Kickoff (Application Menu) widget without the patch which introduces a permanent search field since Plasma 5.15.

The reason for this project's existence is that the author does not believe the current implementation of the search field to be satisfactory enough. Namely, the field sticks out too much, especially when using very transparent themes.

The intention of the project is to keep providing backported fixes to Kickoff, all the while retaining its fieldless look. 


Comparison between Kickoff and Kickoff (Fieldless):
